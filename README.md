# Solar-Powered City Simulation  

This project is an OpenGL-based simulation of a modern urban environment with a focus on renewable energy, particularly solar power.
It demonstrates how cities function under normal conditions and during blackout scenarios, highlighting the resilience of solar-powered infrastructure.  

## Core Features  
- **Day and Night Cycle** with sun, moon, and background transitions.  
- **Moving Clouds** for dynamic atmosphere.  
- **Buildings with Solar Panels** that remain powered during blackouts.  
- **Roads, Vehicles, and Headlights** adapting to day/night.  
- **Airplane Animation** for aerial realism.  
- **Streetlights** that glow at night and shut down in blackout.  
- **Blackout Simulation** contrasting grid vs. solar power.  
- **Trees and Green Spaces** for sustainability.  
- **Railway and Train System** showcasing public transport.  
- **Power Poles and Electric Grid** to visualize dependency.  
- **User Interactivity** (keyboard controls for blackout and solar).  

## Project Contents  
- **Source Code** – C++ with OpenGL implementation.  
- **Screenshots** – Captures of different simulation scenarios.  
- **Project Report** – Detailed documentation of features, design, and findings.
